## Data Notes.
Coverage Data with a suffix "_2020" is from the current June 2019 477, suffix "_2015" is from June 2015 477.
Only residential providers and plans are considered.
Pricing data comes from publicly available plan data from more than 2,000 internet service providers in the third quarter of 2020.
The regular monthly price (not temporary promotional pricing) is considered as the price unless the only known or advertised price for a plan is the promotional rate.
All plans are internet-only. TV and/or Phone inclusive plans (Double, Triple Play, etc) are not considered.
There are cases where a zip has providers indicating coverage but no qualifying plans. In these cases, the Lowest Priced Terrestrial Broadband Plan is NULL.
The coverage data comes from the latest FCC form 477 reporting, which is enhanced and supplemented by provider coverage update submissions directly to BroadbandNow.  
Speed test data comes Measurement Lab network diagnostic tool speed tests. "							
							
## QA Process
Random zips were spot checked for accuracy by looking through the census block logs and raw plan pricing data to verify accuracy.

## Version
This data is published December 9, 2020 and is current as of October 2020. Any plan that has been active since July 2020 was considered at their current active price.
